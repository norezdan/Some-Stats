# Hello !
This repo currently has a RMarkdown file containing summary statistics and parametric hypothesis testing for a dear friend who just started a PhD. Hopefully this helps get you through your quant classes. 
If you found this by chance ;), note that I am using an education data set to make the concepts more concrete for my dear friend.
